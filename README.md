# Caddy GFWReport Plugin

A high-performance Caddy plugin for asynchronous HTTP request analysis and threat detection with comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Overview

The `gfwreport` plugin provides real-time threat detection for Caddy web servers by analyzing HTTP requests asynchronously against configurable patterns for IP addresses, request paths, and User-Agent strings. When threats are detected, the plugin can report them via HTTP webhooks, execute shell commands, or both.

## Features

- **🚀 Asynchronous Processing**: Request analysis doesn't block normal HTTP request handling
- **🎯 Pattern Matching**: Supports IP CIDR blocks, regex path patterns, and User-Agent wildcards
- **📡 Flexible Reporting**: HTTP webhooks and shell command execution for threat notifications
- **🔒 Thread-Safe**: Concurrent request processing with configurable worker pools
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized for minimal latency impact on web traffic
- **🛡️ Security-First**: Built-in URL validation and secure configuration parsing
- **📊 Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit tests, integration tests, and benchmarks
- **🔧 Easy Configuration**: Simple Caddyfile syntax with backward compatibility

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Plugin

```bash
# Using the build script (recommended)
./build.sh xcaddy

# Or manually with xcaddy
xcaddy build --with github.com/ysicing/caddy2-extra/gfwreport=./gfwreport
```

### 2. Basic Configuration

Create a `Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile
{
    order gfwreport before file_server
}

localhost:8080 {
    gfwreport {
        file /path/to/patterns.txt
        hook {
            remote https://your-webhook.com/api/threats
            exec "/usr/local/bin/alert-script.sh"
        }
    }
    file_server
}
```

### 3. Create Pattern File

Create `/path/to/patterns.txt`:

```
# IP CIDR patterns
IP-CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24
IP-CIDR: 10.0.0.0/8

# User-Agent patterns (supports wildcards)
UA: curl/*
UA: wget/*
UA: python-requests/*

# Path patterns (regex supported)
PATH: /admin/.*
PATH: /.env
PATH: /config
PATH: /wp-admin/.*
```

### 4. Run Caddy

```bash
./caddy run --config Caddyfile
```

## Configuration Reference

### Caddyfile Syntax

#### Basic Configuration
```caddyfile
gfwreport {
    file /path/to/patterns.txt
}
```

#### Full Configuration
```caddyfile
gfwreport {
    file /path/to/patterns.txt
    hook {
        remote https://api.security.com/threats
        exec "/usr/local/bin/process-threat.sh"
    }
}
```

#### Legacy Support
```caddyfile
gfwreport {
    file /path/to/patterns.txt
    remote https://webhook.example.com/api  # Legacy syntax
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Description | Required |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|
| `file` | string | Path to pattern file | No* |
| `hook.remote` | string | HTTP webhook URL for threat reporting | No |
| `hook.exec` | string | Shell command to execute on threat detection | No |

*At least one of `file` or `hook` must be specified.

### Pattern File Format

The pattern file supports three types of patterns:

#### IP CIDR Patterns
```
IP-CIDR: 192.168.1.0/24
IP-CIDR: 10.0.0.0/8
IP-CIDR: 172.16.0.0/12
```

#### User-Agent Patterns (Wildcard Support)
```
UA: curl/*
UA: wget/*
UA: python-requests/*
UA: *bot*
UA: scanner*
```

#### Path Patterns (Regex Support)
```
PATH: /admin/.*
PATH: /.env
PATH: /config
PATH: /wp-admin/.*
PATH: ^/api/v[0-9]+/admin
```

## Core Components

### GFWReportHandler
Main Caddy handler that implements the HTTP middleware interface and coordinates all plugin components.

### PatternManager
Manages malicious pattern rules loaded from configuration files with thread-safe access.

### RequestAnalyzer
Handles asynchronous request analysis using a worker pool and bounded queue.

### EventReporter
Reports detected threats via HTTP webhooks or shell command execution with retry logic.

## Development Status

This plugin is actively developed with a solid foundation and comprehensive testing suite.
